# CircuitPlayground
ScratchX extension for the Adafruit Circuit Playground!

With this extension you will be able to use the Circuit Playground board with ScratchX in your Chrome browser. That will allow it to work on Windows, OSX, and even Chromebook.

The Circuit Playground has several peripherals onboard. You'll be able to control Neopixels, get light and sound readings, and more. We will also be developing our own peripherals for it that plugin with a simple alligator clip for easy wiring.

This Scratch extension is based on work done by BirdBrain Technologies.
