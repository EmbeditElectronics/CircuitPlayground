LUFA (Lightweight USB For AVRs) on the Arduino!

## Description

Modern Arduinos ([Arduino Leonardo], [Arduino Micro], [Arduino Esplora], [Arduino Lilypad USB], and the Upcoming [Arduino Tre]) came with a ATmega32u4 which have a native USB interface on the MCU. The Arduino IDE also came with a tiny USB stack that has a USB CDC Serial, a Keyboard, and a Mouse. It might be enough if you're migrating old projects (form ATmega168/328's) to the new hardware, but when you want to unleash the full power of it, you'd find that the current implementations lasks extensibility (BADLY!).

Thus, I managed to bring the powerful [LUFA] to Arduino!

## Installation
The installation is quiet tricky, because the stock USB stack is in the arduino core directory instead of a seperated library directory, so you cannot simply drop [Arduino-Lufa] to the library folder under your Sketchbook directory.

There are some more setups besides that...

1. clone the repository, drop in your `<Sketchbook>/libraries` (for instance, you should have `Sketchbook/libraries/LUFA/LUFA.h` after this step.
2. download [LUFA], put everything under `LUFA/` to `<Sketchbook>/libraries/LUFA/LUFA` (for instance, you should have `<Sketchbook>/libraries/LUFA/LUFA/Drivers/USB/USB.h` after this step)
3. delete the stock USB stack from Arduino environment, there are 6 files to be deleted:
  1. `Arduino/hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino/CDC.cpp`
  2. `Arduino/hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino/HID.cpp`
  3. `Arduino/hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino/USBApi.h`
  4. `Arduino/hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino/USBCore.cpp`
  5. `Arduino/hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino/USBCore.h`
  6. `Arduino/hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino/USBDesc.h`
4. edit these 3 files to remove all USB related stuff (if you just dunno how, replace them with the files from `ArduinoHardwareAVR` folder):
  1. `Arduino/hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino/Arduino.h`
    * 222: `#include "USBAPI.h"`
    * 223: `#if defined(HAVE_HWSERIAL0) && defined(HAVE_CDCSERIAL)`
    * 224: `#error "Targets with both UART0 and CDC serial not supported"`
    * 225: `#endif`
  2. `Arduino/hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino/main.cpp`
    * 26: `#if defined(USBCON)`
    * 27: `USBDevice.attach();`
    * 28: `#endif`
  3. `Arduino/hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino/Platform.h`
    * 17: `#if defined(USBCON)`
    * 18: `#include "USBDesc.h"`
	* 19: `#include "USBCore.h"`
	* 20: `#include "USBAPI.h"`
    * 21: `#endif /* if defined(USBCON) */`

That's it! You can now try start the Arduino IDE and compile the examples! :-)

## Note
* By uploading the sketch to the board, you lose the ability to reset the board with setting-up 1200 baudrate, connect, then disconnect. This is used by the Arduino IDE to reset the board while uploading sketch. You can to manually reset the board by pressing the hardware reset button when the console prompts something similar to:

<code>Forcing reset using 1200bps open/close on port COM5    
PORTS {COM1, COM5, COM6, } / {COM1, COM5, COM6, } => {}    
PORTS {COM1, COM5, COM6, } / {COM1, COM5, COM6, } => {}    
PORTS {COM1, COM5, COM6, } / {COM1, COM5, COM6, } => {}    
...</code>

* If done correctly, the LED on pin 13 will being fading and you'll see the upload taking progress in the console.
